Description
-----------
Octopus is a http-based API for relaying messages between applications.

Possible use-cases
------------------
- Make your web-application announce new support tickets to an IRC room.
- Let nagios announce warnings for your servers.
- Wire your bread-toaster so you can AIM notifications when your toast is ready.

Warning
-------
If you are reading this then this software is still very alpha! Be warned that the internal API will probably undergo so major 
changes. Don't use it in production, please :)
